From Mike Fletcher:

You probably want to learn to use arrays before you try to learn to
use vbos (which are basically the same pattern, but with a few extra
bits to speed it up).  OpenGLContext's tests directory has lots of
array-based sample drawing code, e.g:

If you want to try vbos immediately, look at test_vbo here:
